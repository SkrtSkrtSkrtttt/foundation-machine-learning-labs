Foundations of Machine Learning

This repository contains lab work, code, and experiments completed under the guidance of Professor Vibha Mane. The focus is on applying fundamental machine learning concepts to practical problems using Python, PyTorch, and related tools.

üìå Overview

The work here is structured into modules that explore both the theory and application of machine learning, covering a range of tasks including clustering, classification, and prediction. Each section includes source code, plots, and supporting notes for deeper understanding.
